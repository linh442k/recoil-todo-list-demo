In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple todo-list application. Our app will be able to do the following:
    1. Add todo items
    2. Edit todo items
    3. Delete todo items
    4. Filter todo items
    5. Display useful stats
Along the way, we'll cover atoms, selectors, atom families, and the hooks exposed by the Recoil API. We'll also cover optimization.
